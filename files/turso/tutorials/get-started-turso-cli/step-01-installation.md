# Step 1: Installation

## macOS instructions​

To install the Turso CLI on macOS, we recommend that you use Homebrew:

`brew  install  tursodatabase/tap/turso`

The formula includes an executable with autocompletion scripts for bash, fish,
and zsh.

If you don't use Homebrew, you can use the following command to execute a shell script that installs the CLI:

`curl  -sSfL https://get.tur.so/install.sh  |   bash`

## Linux instructions​

Run the following command to execute a shell script that installs the CLI:

`curl  -sSfL https://get.tur.so/install.sh  |   bash`

## Windows instructions​

Installing the Turso CLI on Windows requires that you have[ WSL installed ](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install). You run the scripted install within a WSL shell.
For example, run the following command in PowerShell to start a WSL shell:

`wsl`

You can then use the following command to execute a shell script that installs the CLI:

`curl  -sSfL https://get.tur.so/install.sh  |   bash`

## Verify the installation​

info

If you used the scripted installer, the CLI is installed in a directory called `.turso` in your home directory. The
shell script will attempt to add that to your shell’s PATH. You will need to
start a new shell to see the change, or add it manually to the current shell by
running the `source` command printed by the installer.

Run the following command to make sure the Turso CLI is in your PATH:

`turso --version`

You will need Turso CLI version 0.85.0 or later for this tutorial.
