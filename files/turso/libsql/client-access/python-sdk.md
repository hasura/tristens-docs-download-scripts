# Python SDK

The Python SDK comes with APIs for both synchronous and asynchronous code.

## Installation​

Add the[ libsql-client module ](https://github.com/libsql/libsql-client-py/)to your project using `pip` :

`$ pip  install  libsql-client`

## Initialization​

Import the module using `libsql_client` :

`import  libsql_client`

If you want to use the synchronous API, use the `create_client_sync` function:

```
client  =  libsql_client . create_client_sync (
    url = "libsql://your-database.turso.io"
    auth_token = "your-auth-token"
)
```

If you want to use the asynchronous API, use the `create_client` function along
with `asyncio` and async/await syntax:

```
client  =  libsql_client . create_client (
    url = "libsql://your-database.turso.io"
    auth_token = "your-auth-token"
)
```

note

Do not use `await` with `create_client()` . Only the database operations require
that.

The `auth_token` parameter is only required when using a remote database
instance managed by Turso.

In either case, the returned object exposes an identical API, though they are
are defined with different classes. The synchronous client is a thin wrapper
around the asynchronous client.

The examples on this page use the synchronous API. The equivalent async code can
be easily derived from that by applying `async` and `await` .  For example, a
synchronous call to the client's `execute()` method takes this form:

```
with  client :
    result_set  =  client . execute ( "..." )
     # Work with query results
```

While an asynchronous call takes this form:

```
async   with  client :
    result_set  =   await  client . execute ( "..." )
     # Work with query results
```

In both cases above, the `with` keyword is used to close the client after the
work is complete. If you want to work with the client object across functions,
you should call `close()` on it after you're done with the client to clean up
the resources it uses.

## Example data set​

All of the examples in this section assume tables and data established by these
statements:

```
create   table  example_users  (
    uid  text   primary   key ,
    email  text
) ;
create   table  example_scores  (
    uid  text ,
     level   integer ,
    score  integer ,
     primary   key   ( uid ,   level )
) ;
insert   into  example_users  values   ( 'uid1' ,   'foo@bar.com' ) ;
insert   into  example_users  values   ( 'uid2' ,   'baz@bar.com' ) ;
insert   into  example_scores  values   ( 'uid1' ,   1 ,   100 ) ;
insert   into  example_scores  values   ( 'uid1' ,   2 ,   95 ) ;
```

## Execute a single statement​

### SQL string argument​

You can execute a single statement with the `execute()` method of a Client
object. It returns a[ ResultSet ](https://docs.turso.tech//libsql/client-access/python-sdk/#resultset)object containing the results of
the query.

```
rs  =  client . execute ( "select * from users" )
# rs.columns == ('uid', 'email')
# rs.rows[0] == ('uid1', 'foo@bar.com')
# rs.rows[1] == ('uid2', 'baz@bar.com')
```

### Positional placeholders​

libSQL supports positional placeholders using the same syntax as SQLite. Pass
two parameters, with the first ( `stmt` ) being the SQL string with placeholders,
and the second ( `args` ) being a list of values to bind to the placeholders.

```
rs  =  client . execute (
     "select score from example_scores where uid = ? and level = ?" ,
     [   "uid1" ,   2   ]
)
# rs.columns == ('score',)
# rs.rows[0] == (95,)
```

### Named placeholders​

libSQL supports named placeholders using the same syntax as SQLite. Pass two
parameters, with the first ( `stmt` ) must be the SQL string with placeholders,
and the second ( `args` ) must be a dictionary whose keys match the names of the
placeholders, and whose values will be bound to the placeholders.

```
rs  =  client . execute (
     "insert into example_scores values (:uid, :level, :score)" ,
     {   "uid" :   "uid2" ,   "level" :   1 ,   "score" :   50   }
)
# rs.columns == ()
# rs.rows == []
# rs.rows_affected == 1
```

In the above example, there are placeholders for `uid` , `level` , and `score` using the prefix character `:` . The values of the matching properties of `args` are bound to each placeholder.

libSQL supports the same named placeholder prefix characters as SQLite: `:` , `@` , and `$` .

## Execute a batch of statements​

info

Be sure to read the[ common section on batches ](https://docs.turso.tech/libsql/client-access#batches)for libSQL clients to understand
their behavior.

To execute multiple statements in a transaction, use the `batch()` method on the
client object, passing it an list of statements. The list may contain any type
of statement that is also accepted by[ execute() ](https://docs.turso.tech//libsql/client-access/python-sdk/#execute-a-single-statement). `batch()` returns a list of[ ResultSet ](https://docs.turso.tech//libsql/client-access/python-sdk/#resultset)objects (one for each statement).

The following code inserts a row for uid3 in two different tables using a
transaction that commits them both at the same time.

```
rss  =  client . batch ( [
    libsql_client . Statement (
         "insert into example_users values (?, ?)" ,
         [   "uid3" ,   "uid3@turso.tech"   ]
     ) ,
    libsql_client . Statement (
         "insert into example_scores values (?, ?, ?)" ,
         [   "uid3" ,   1 ,   200   ]
     ) ,
] )
# rss[0].columns == ()
# rss[0].rows == []
# rss[0].rows_affected == 1
# rss[1].columns == ()
# rss[1].rows == []
# rss[1].rows_affected == 1
```

## Interactive transactions​

info

Be sure to read the[ common section on interactive transactions ](https://docs.turso.tech/libsql/client-access#interactive-transactions)for libSQL
clients to understand their behavior.

Use the `transaction()` method on the client object to create a Transaction
object to issue read and write statements to be executed atomically. It provides
the following methods:

| Method | Description |
|---|---|
|  `execute()`  | Similar to the normal client `execute()` , except within the context of the transaction |
|  `commit()`  | Commits all the write statements in the transaction |
|  `rollback()`  | Rolls back the entire transaction |
|  `close()`  | Immediately stops the transaction; must be called if the transaction was not committed or rolled back in order to free resources. Use `with` on the transaction object to ensure this happens automatically. This is always synchronous even with the async API. |


The following code uses an interactive transaction to update a user’s level
score, but only if it’s greater than the one that currently exists:

```
uid  =   "uid1"
level  =   1
new_score  =   200
with  client . transaction ( )   as  transaction :
    rs  =  transaction . execute (
         "select score from example_scores where uid = ? and level = ?" ,
         [  uid ,  level  ]
     )
     # rs.columns == ('score',)
     # rs.rows[0] == (200,)
    old_score  =  rs . rows [ 0 ] [ "score" ]
     if  new_score  >  old_score :
        transaction . execute (
             "update example_scores set score = ? where uid = ? and level = ?" ,
             [  new_score ,  uid ,  level  ]
         )
    transaction . commit ( )
```

## ResultSet​

Database queries always yield a ResultSet object. This object has the following
attribute:

| Attribute | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
|  `rows`  |  `List[Row]`  | A list of Row objects containing the row values, empty for write operations |
|  `columns`  |  `Tuple[str, ...]`  | An tuple of strings with the names of the columns in the order they appear in each Row, empty for write operations |
|  `rows_affected`  |  `int`  | The number of rows affected by a write statement, 0 otherwise |
|  `last_insert_rowid`  |  `Optional[int]`  | The rowid of a newly inserted row, if there was one |


A ResultSet can also be used as a Sequence of Row objects. The following are all
valid on a ResultSet `rs` :

- `rs[0]` to get the first row
- `len(rs)` to get the number of rows
- `for row in rs` to iterate the rows


A Row object is a[ Sequence ](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#sequence-types-list-tuple-range)that contains the values of a row in a ResultSet.
It can be indexed by either an integer column index or the name of the column.
Each element of a Row can have one of the following types, depending on the
source of data:

- `None` (for SQL NULL)
- `str`
- `int`
- `float`
- `bytes` (for blobs)


```
rs  =  client . execute (
     "select level, score from example_scores where uid = ?" ,
     [   "uid1"   ]
)
for  row  in  rs . rows :
     # Can index row by column number
    level1  =  row [ 0 ]
    score1  =  row [ 1 ]
     # Can also index row by column name
    level2  =  row [ "level" ]
    score2  =  row [ "score" ]
```
