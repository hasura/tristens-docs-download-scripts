# Hasura Native Data Connectors Overview

Native Data Connectors are a way to connect your Hasura GraphQL Engine to external data sources.

You can use them to query and join data across multiple data sources. Built using the[ Native Data Connector Specification ](https://github.com/hasura/ndc-spec/), you can use the ones that are available out of the box, or build your own.
