# Data Domain Modeling

Hasura now uses the Open Data Domain Specification (OpenDD spec) as the foundation for constructing your data supergraph.

This specification serves as the definitive reference for your organization's data graph and APIs over it. It offers a declarative approach for defining your data models and configuring access-controlled APIs to access the data.
