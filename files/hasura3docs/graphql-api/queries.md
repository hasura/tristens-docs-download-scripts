# GraphQL Queries

Queries are used to read data from the database. Hasura provides a powerful GraphQL API to query your data.

You can use the GraphiQL interface in the Hasura Console to explore your API and help you to write queries.

Depending on the features enabled by a Native Data Connector, you will have access to a range of queries as defined
