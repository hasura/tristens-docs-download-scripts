# GraphQL API

When you add a new data connector to Hasura, depending on the source and the abilities of the connector, you'll be able to interact with your related and deeply nested data easily with the power of GraphQL.

Documentation for data connectors can be found either in the[ Connector Hub ](https://hasura.io/connectors)or in the repo of each connector itself. With the data connector documentation, you'll be able to find which of the GraphQL queries documented in this section are available to you.

Hasura supports only queries at this stage, with mutations and subscriptions coming soon
