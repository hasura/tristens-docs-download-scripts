# Hasura DDN Documentation

Welcome to Hasura DDN public alpha!

We're happy to have you with us and are excited to share what we've been working on.

Hasura Data Delivery Network (DDN) provides instant GraphQL APIs on various data sources. It's a new way for backend teams to provide data access from the edge in a reliable, performant and secure way.

Hasura brings you lightning-fast builds, a declarative metadata specification, and a set of developer tools to make you and your teams more productive than ever.

This documentation is a work in progress and we would love your feedback. If you have any suggestions or find any bugs, please use our handy feedback component on each page and reach out.
