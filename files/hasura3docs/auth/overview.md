## Using Authenticationâ€‹

### JWT Mode

With JWT Mode, Hasura can easily integrate with your existing authentication service and rapidly help you configure granular access to your data.

### Webhook Mode

With webhook mode you can specify a URL for Hasura to call which will return user information in session variables.

### Role Emulation

Hasura can be set up to emulate roles and process requests using the defined access-control rules for another role. This can be useful for testing without setting up authentication.
