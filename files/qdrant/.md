# Documentation

 **Qdrant (read: quadrant)** is a vector similarity search engine. Use our documentation to develop a production-ready service with a convenient API to store, search, and manage vectors with an additional payload. Qdrant’s expanding features allow for all sorts of neural network or semantic-based matching, faceted search, and other applications.

## First-Time Users:

There are three ways to use Qdrant:

1. [ Run a Docker image ](quick-start/)if you don’t have a Python development environment. Setup a local Qdrant server and storage in a few moments.
2. [ Get the Python client ](https://github.com/qdrant/qdrant-client)if you’re familiar with Python. Just `pip install qdrant-client` . The client uses an in-memory database.
3. [ Spin up a Qdrant Cloud cluster: ](cloud/)the recommended method to run Qdrant in production. Read[ Quickstart ](cloud/quickstart-cloud/)to setup your first instance.

First, try Qdrant locally using the[ Qdrant Client ](https://github.com/qdrant/qdrant-client)and with the help of our[ Tutorials ](tutorials/)and Guides. Develop a sample app from our[ Examples ](examples/)list and try it using a[ Qdrant Docker ](guides/installation/)container. Then, when you are ready for production, deploy to a Free Tier[ Qdrant Cloud ](cloud/)cluster.
