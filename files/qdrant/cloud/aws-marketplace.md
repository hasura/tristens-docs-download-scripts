# Qdrant Cloud on AWS Marketplace

## Overview

Our[ AWS Marketplace ](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-rtphb42tydtzg)listing streamlines access to Qdrant for users who rely on Amazon Web Services for hosting and application development. Please note that, while Qdrant’s clusters run on AWS, you will still use the Qdrant Cloud infrastructure.

## Billing

You don’t need to use a credit card to sign up for Qdrant Cloud. Instead, all billing is processed through the AWS Marketplace and the usage of Qdrant is added to your existing billing for AWS services. It is common for AWS to abstract usage based pricing in the AWS marketplace, as there are too many factors to model when calculating billing from the AWS side.
