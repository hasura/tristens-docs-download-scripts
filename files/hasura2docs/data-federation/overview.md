# GraphQL Federation

Federation with GraphQL and Hasura allows you to combine multiple sub-graphs into a supergraph. This allows you to combine data from multiple sources into a single, consolidated endpoint.

These sub-graphs can be sourced from different data sources such as databases, REST APIs, or GraphQL APIs, streamlining queries and mutations while maintaining the flexibility and modularity of the underlying services.
