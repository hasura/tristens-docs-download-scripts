# Amazon Redshift

## Introduction​

Hasura allows connecting to an Amazon Redshift service to build a GraphQL API based on the schema of the service.

Supported versions:

1. Hasura GraphQL Engine `v2.35.0` onwards
2. [ Amazon Redshift ](https://aws.amazon.com/redshift/)


## Get Started​

To try Hasura with Amazon Redshift, you'll need your own new or existing Amazon Redshift instance.

Here are 2 ways you can get started with Hasura and Amazon Redshift:

1. [ Hasura Cloud ](https://hasura.io/docs/latest/databases/redshift/getting-started/cloud/): You'll need to be able to access your Amazon Redshift
instance service from Hasura Cloud.
2. [ Docker ](https://hasura.io/docs/latest/databases/redshift/getting-started/docker/): Run Hasura with Docker and then connect your Amazon Redshift
instance to Hasura.


## Supported features​

Note

Currently, Hasura supports read-only queries, relationships, and permissions on Amazon Redshift.

## Managing data with the Hasura Console​

The Hasura Console is a web UI that allows you to manage your data and metadata. It is available at `http://localhost:8080/console` when you run Hasura locally, or from your project's Console endpoint when you use[ Hasura Cloud ](https://cloud.hasura.io).

The data-management features (such as creating tables) are available in the `Data` tab. You can access your GraphQL API
in the `API` tab and interact with it using the GraphiQL interface.

Console support

We recommend using your preferred Amazon Redshift client instead. The Hasura Console is designed to be a tool for managing
your GraphQL API, and not a full-fledged database management tool.
