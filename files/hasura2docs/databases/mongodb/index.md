# MongoDB

## Introduction​

Supported versions:

Hasura GraphQL Engine `v2.27.0` onwards

Supported features

Hasura currently supports queries, table relationships, remote relationships and permissions on MongoDB databases.

A[ logical model ](https://hasura.io/docs/latest/schema/mongodb/logical-models/)or database[ validation schema ](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/upcoming/core/schema-validation/specify-json-schema/#std-label-schema-validation-json)is required for generating your GraphQL schema.

## Get Started​

To try Hasura with MongoDB, you'll need a new or existing MongoDB instance (either self-hosted, or available through[ MongoDB Atlas ](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas/database)).

To get started with MongoDB:

- In Hasura Cloud, check out our[ Getting Started with MongoDB in Hasura Cloud ](https://hasura.io/docs/latest/databases/mongodb/cloud/)guide
- In a Docker environment, check out our[ Getting Started with Docker ](https://hasura.io/docs/latest/databases/mongodb/docker/)guide


## Managing data with the Hasura Console​

The Hasura Console is a web UI that allows you to manage your data and metadata. It is available at `http://localhost:8080/console` when you run Hasura locally, or from your project's Console endpoint when you use[ Hasura Cloud ](https://cloud.hasura.io).

The data-management features (such as creating tables) are available in the `Data` tab. You can access your GraphQL API
in the `API` tab and interact with it using the GraphiQL interface.

Console support

We recommend using your preferred MongoDB client instead. The Hasura Console is designed to be a tool for managing
your GraphQL API, and not a full-fledged database management tool.
