# Get Started with Snowflake

To try Hasura with Snowflake, you'll need a new or existing Snowflake database.

Here are 2 ways you can get started with Hasura and Snowflake:

1. [ Hasura Cloud ](https://hasura.io/docs/latest/databases/snowflake/getting-started/cloud/): You'll need to be able to access your Snowflake
service from Hasura Cloud.
2. [ Docker ](https://hasura.io/docs/latest/databases/snowflake/getting-started/docker/): Run Hasura with Docker and then connect your Snowflake
service to Hasura.
