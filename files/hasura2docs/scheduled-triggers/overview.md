# Scheduled Triggers

Scheduled Triggers are a way to run custom business logic on a schedule. They are a powerful way to automate your tasks and integrate with other services.

With Scheduled Triggers, you can create Cron Jobs that run at specified intervals, or run a one-off task at a specified time, or even automate data clean to regularly keep your data and logs in order.
