# Mutations

The Hasura GraphQL Engine automatically generates GraphQL mutation fields for inserting, updating, or deleting data based on your database's schema. For any tracked table, a set of mutations are generated and exposed as part of the GraphQL API.

Just as with queries, as soon you paste in your connection string and track your tables, you're ready to start writing mutations!
