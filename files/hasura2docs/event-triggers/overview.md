# Event Triggers

Hasura Event triggers are a way to automate asynchronous logic when changes are made in a connected database.

Event Triggers can be configured to activate when there is an `INSERT` , `UPDATE` or `DELETE` event in a table. Additionally, you can manually trigger an event through a button set up in the Hasura Console.
