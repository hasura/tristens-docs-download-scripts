# Event Trigger Samples

## Boilerplates​

Here are a few boilerplates you can use to build and deploy event
triggers on different cloud providers:

- Source code:[ https://github.com/hasura/graphql-engine/tree/master/community/boilerplates/event-triggers ](https://github.com/hasura/graphql-engine/tree/master/community/boilerplates/event-triggers)


There are 2 types of boilerplates:

 **Echo** Returns the event payload with some augmented data. It helps
you in understanding the event payload and parsing it.

 **Mutation** Makes a mutation based on the event payload. It helps in
understanding database access inside an Event Trigger.
