# Quickstart Auth

In this quickstart, we'll use a JWT and permissions to limit a query to only the user making the request. We're using
our sample app, which you can read more about below. If you don't use the sample app, you'll need to ensure your data
model includes a `users` table and modify the values of the encoded and decoded JWT to match your user's information.

##### DOCS E-COMMERCE SAMPLE APP

You can use this quickstart with any project, but it pairs well with our docs e-commerce sample app, which you can deploy to Hasura Cloud with one click below. If you've already deployed the sample app,[ access your existing project. ](https://cloud.hasura.io)

## Step 1: Add an environment variable‚Äã

Depending on how your instance is deployed, you can either use the GUI or your configuration files to set this secret.

- Cloud
- Self-hosted


Head to your Project's settings page and click on the Env vars option in the side navigation:

Once there, click on New Env Var and select `HASURA_GRAPHQL_JWT_SECRET` from the `Key` field. Paste this value into the
environment variable's value field:

```
{
   "key" :   "oursupersecretsupersecurekey1234567890" ,
   "type" :   "HS256"
}
```

Click `Add` :

In your `docker-compose.yml` , add the following environment variable and value:

`HASURA_GRAPHQL_JWT_SECRET :   '{ "type": "HS256", "key": "oursupersecretsupersecurekey1234567890" }'`

If you don't already have a `users` table, add one with the following SQL using the `Data` tab's SQL editor:

```
CREATE   TABLE  users  (
  id uuid  NOT   NULL ,
  name  text   NOT   NULL ,
  email  text   NOT   NULL ,
   PRIMARY   KEY   ( id )
) ;
```

Then, insert these users:

```
INSERT   INTO   public . users  ( id ,  name ,  email )   VALUES   ( '7cf0a66c-65b7-11ed-b904-fb49f034fbbb' ,   'Sean' ,   'seandemo@hasura.io' ) ;
INSERT   INTO   public . users  ( id ,  name ,  email )   VALUES   ( '82001336-65b7-11ed-b905-7fa26a16d198' ,   'Rob' ,   'robdemo@hasura.io' ) ;
INSERT   INTO   public . users  ( id ,  name ,  email )   VALUES   ( '86d5fba0-65b7-11ed-b906-afb985970e2e' ,   'Marion' ,   'mariondemo@hasura.io' ) ;
INSERT   INTO   public . users  ( id ,  name ,  email )   VALUES   ( '8dea1160-65b7-11ed-b907-e3c5123cb650' ,   'Sandeep' ,   'sandeepdemo@hasura.io' ) ;
INSERT   INTO   public . users  ( id ,  name ,  email )   VALUES   ( '9bd9d300-65b7-11ed-b908-571fef22d2ba' ,   'Abby' ,   'abbydemo@hasura.io' ) ;
```

## Step 2: Create a user role‚Äã

Head to the `Data` tab of the Hasura Console. If you have a `users` table, select it from the list on the left-hand
side, and open the `Permissions` tab:

Image: [ Authentication and authorization with Hasura ](https://hasura.io/docs/assets/images/auth-jwt_getting-started-guide_2.18.0_default-roles-c80b13dccb1aada302289416ee132744.png)

As you can see, we currently only have an admin role. To make access to data more granular, we'll create a new role by
entering `user` into the text input. After entering the name of the role, click the ‚ùå in the `select` column:

Image: [ Authentication and authorization with Hasura ](https://hasura.io/docs/assets/images/auth-jwt_getting-started-guide_2.18.0_add-user-role-97f6e0a3cccb653403580bb063193ccd.png)

Configure the `Row select permissions` by choosing `With custom check` and pasting the following value in the editor on
line 1:

`{   "id" :   {   "_eq" :   "X-Hasura-User-Id"   }   }`

Configure the `Column select permissions` by clicking `Toggle All` :

Finally, click `Save Permissions` .

## Step 3: Add a header in the GraphiQL explorer‚Äã

Head back to the `API` tab and add a new row to the `Request Headers` . Enter this `key` :

`Authorization`

And this value:

`Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiIxMjM0NTY3ODkwIiwibmFtZSI6IlNlYW4iLCJlbWFpbCI6InNlYW5kZW1vQGhhc3VyYS5pbyIsImlhdCI6MTUxNjIzOTAyMiwiaHR0cHM6Ly9oYXN1cmEuaW8vand0L2NsYWltcyI6eyJ4LWhhc3VyYS1hbGxvd2VkLXJvbGVzIjpbInVzZXIiLCJhZG1pbiJdLCJ4LWhhc3VyYS1kZWZhdWx0LXJvbGUiOiJ1c2VyIiwieC1oYXN1cmEtdXNlci1pZCI6IjdjZjBhNjZjLTY1YjctMTFlZC1iOTA0LWZiNDlmMDM0ZmJiYiJ9fQ.jSp42PsCa4r-2ObfopkiDBvTn9nDysIv-NOIEnU3wR0`

Check the box next to `Authorization` ; the final result should look like this:

## Step 4: Test it out‚Äã

Before demonstrating the access control you just designed, run the following query:

```
query   GetUsers   {
   users   {
     id
     email
     name
   }
}
```

You should see an array of 5 records returned:

```
{
   "data" :   {
     "users" :   [
       {
         "id" :   "7cf0a66c-65b7-11ed-b904-fb49f034fbbb" ,
         "email" :   "seandemo@hasura.io" ,
         "name" :   "Sean"
       } ,
       {
         "id" :   "82001336-65b7-11ed-b905-7fa26a16d198" ,
         "email" :   "robdemo@hasura.io" ,
         "name" :   "Rob"
       } ,
       {
         "id" :   "86d5fba0-65b7-11ed-b906-afb985970e2e" ,
         "email" :   "mariondemo@hasura.io" ,
         "name" :   "Marion"
       } ,
       {
         "id" :   "8dea1160-65b7-11ed-b907-e3c5123cb650" ,
         "email" :   "sandeepdemo@hasura.io" ,
         "name" :   "Sandeep"
       } ,
       {
         "id" :   "9bd9d300-65b7-11ed-b908-571fef22d2ba" ,
         "email" :   "abbydemo@hasura.io" ,
         "name" :   "Abby"
       }
     ]
   }
}
```

Uncheck the `x-hasura-admin-secret` request header. Re-run the query; this time, your output should be similar to this:

```
{
   "data" :   {
     "users" :   [
       {
         "id" :   "7cf0a66c-65b7-11ed-b904-fb49f034fbbb" ,
         "email" :   "seandemo@hasura.io" ,
         "name" :   "Sean"
       }
     ]
   }
}
```

Did you see that?!

If you weren't watching closely, you may have missed it. When you deselected your admin secret in the request headers
and used only the `authorization` header, the available schema changed to what you defined in step 2 üî•

You can see that in the screenshot below, the only field available to the user is the `users` table:

## Recap‚Äã

What did we just do? Well, you just implemented a JWT-based authorization system with Hasura üéâ

Is this production-grade? Not quite. In a real-world application, you'd need to generate and verify the[ JWTs ](https://hasura.io/docs/latest/auth/authentication/jwt/)on the server-side. You'd also need to implement a mechanism to refresh the JWTs.
What we've demonstrated is how Hasura utilizes the JWT to determine the role of the user and the[ permissions ](https://hasura.io/docs/latest/auth/authorization/index/)that they have access to.

The environment variable we set up in the beginning contains a secret; this secret is used to encode your JWTs wherever
they're generated, be it on your own server, a third-party service, or even a client-side library. Hasura is agnostic
about how or where you generate your JWTs. Saving that secret as an environment variable allows Hasura to decode the
JWTs and verify that they're valid.

If you're curious about the composition of the JWT, you can view the decoded version one of two ways. By visiting[ this link ](https://jwt.io/#debugger-io?token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiIxMjM0NTY3ODkwIiwibmFtZSI6IlNlYW4iLCJlbWFpbCI6InNlYW5kZW1vQGhhc3VyYS5pbyIsImlhdCI6MTUxNjIzOTAyMiwiaHR0cHM6Ly9oYXN1cmEuaW8vand0L2NsYWltcyI6eyJ4LWhhc3VyYS1hbGxvd2VkLXJvbGVzIjpbInVzZXIiLCJhZG1pbiJdLCJ4LWhhc3VyYS1kZWZhdWx0LXJvbGUiOiJ1c2VyIiwieC1oYXN1cmEtdXNlci1pZCI6IjdjZjBhNjZjLTY1YjctMTFlZC1iOTA0LWZiNDlmMDM0ZmJiYiJ9fQ.FQJp6we0EFXWtmeqcM3-gAqxeNURL3Qa6AMDM6qv2NE),
you can see the payload and other data associated with the JWT we used in this example. Alternatively, Hasura provides a
JWT decoder tool that you can use to decode any JWT. You can utilize this by clicking the "detective" icon next to the `Authorization` header's value in the GraphiQL explorer.

The permissions we set up in step 2 are the most basic form of access control. We created a new role called `user` and
limited the rows returned on the `users` table to only those whose `id` matches the `x-hasura-user-id` claim in the JWT.

As you can see from the example, Hasura automatically provides a schema that only exposes the `users` table to the `user` role. This is a great way to limit the exposure of your data to the outside world and ensure that your users only
have access to the data they're authorized to see.
