# Authentication and Authorization

Hasura gives you the power to authenticate users how you want, integrating with many popular auth services or your own existing custom solution hosted elsewhere.

With Hasura, you can easily manage access to your data and APIs by defining roles and permissions. Hasura's fine-grained access control system allows you to specify which users can access which data, Actions, and Remote Schema fields, ensuring that your application is secure and robust.

Say goodbye to the headache of managing authentication and authorization and focus on building your application with Hasura.
