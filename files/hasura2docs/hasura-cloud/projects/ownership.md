# Transfer Project Ownership

## Introduction​

You can transfer ownership of your project to another user. After the ownership is transferred successfully, the
original owner will lose all access to the project.

Note

If the project is on the `Standard` or `Professional` (pay-as-you-go) tier, the new owner will pay for the entire data
usage for the month in which the ownership is transferred.

## Send an ownership transfer invitation​

Go to the project settings page and scroll to the bottom. Enter the email of the user you want to transfer the project
ownership to.

You can accept an invitation by clicking on the `Accept` button.

Note

associated with their Hasura Cloud account to accept the invitation.
