## Switching pricing plans​

### Switch from Free to Professional tier​

Once the `Free` tier data limit is exhausted, the project becomes inactive. In order to keep it active, you can switch
to the `Professional` plan.

Go to `Projects` and click on the project you'd like to change.

Now click on the `Usage tab` . To upgrade to the `Professional` plan, click on the `Upgrade` button:

Your project is now running on the `Professional` plan.

### Switch from Professional to Free tier​

Go to `Projects` and click on the project you'd like to change.

Under the `General` tab, find the `Pricing tier` section and click on the edit icon on the right:

You'll be charged as per the `Professional` plan until the end of the day. From the next day onwards, the project will
be on the `Free` tier. If the `Free` tier limit is exhausted, the project might become inactive.

### Switch to and from Enterprise tier​

In order to upgrade to the `Enterprise` plan or to switch back to another plan, please[ contact our sales team ](https://hasura.io/contact-us/?type=hasuraenterprise).
