# Recover Project

## Introduction​

Sometimes you might need to recover a Hasura Cloud Project. This might happen if you need access to a Project that is
owned by a former employee.

As a general rule, for security reasons, we do not support transferring ownership of Projects without the consent of the
current Project owner. Below are some options for how you can recover a Project.

## Option 1: Access through their work email​

If the former employee used a work email, you can contact your email admin to gain access to that email account, and
transfer ownership through there.

## Option 2: Contact the former owner​

If the former employee didn't use a work email to create the Project, or if it's impossible to access their work email,
contact the former employee and ask them to transfer the Project to you.

## Option 3: Create a new Project​

If none of the above options are available for you, you can create a new Project with the same Metadata, Migrations, and
env vars and redirect traffic to the new Project.
