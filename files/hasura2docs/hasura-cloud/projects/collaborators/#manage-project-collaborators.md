# Project Collaborators

## Introduction​

You can invite collaborators to your project and grant them partial or complete access to your Hasura Console. The `Collaborators` tab shows the current people who have access to the project and the people who have been invited to the
project.

## Invite a collaborator​

Click `Invite a Collaborator` to invite a new collaborator by their email.

### Collaborator roles​

Collaborators can have different levels of access in the Hasura Console.

- **Admin** has complete access to the Console, i.e. they can change the schema and the GraphQL Engine Metadata.
- **User** has limited privileges:
    - The `Execute GraphQL` permission allows running queries, mutations and subscriptions from the `GraphiQL` tab of the
Console.
