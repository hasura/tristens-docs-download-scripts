# Coupons and Credits

## Introduction​

If you have a coupon, you can redeem it from the dashboard to get a credit waiver on your next invoice. Discounts will
be adjusted while creating the invoice.

## Redeem a coupon​

Navigate to the `Billing` tab, click on `Coupons and Credits` , enter the code and click on the redeem button. Only one
coupon is applied.

Note If there is an active coupon and another coupon is applied, then the later coupon is used.
