# BigQuery: Schema

The Hasura GraphQL Engine automatically generates your GraphQL schema and resolvers based on your tables/views in
BigQuery. **You don't need to write a GraphQL schema or resolvers.** See[ How Hasura GraphQL Engine works ](https://hasura.io/docs/latest/getting-started/how-it-works/index/)for more details.

The Hasura Console gives you UI tools that speed up your data-modeling process, or working with your existing database.

The Hasura GraphQL Engine lets you do anything you would usually do with BigQuery by giving you GraphQL over native
BigQuery constructs.

 **See:**

- [ Customize auto-generated fields ](https://hasura.io/docs/latest/schema/bigquery/custom-field-names/)
