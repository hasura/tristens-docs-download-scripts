# Snowflake: Schema

The Hasura GraphQL Engine automatically generates your GraphQL schema and resolvers based on your tables/views in
Snowflake. **You don't need to write a GraphQL schema or resolvers.** See[ How Hasura GraphQL Engine works ](https://hasura.io/docs/latest/getting-started/how-it-works/index/)for more details.

The Hasura Console gives you UI tools that speed up your data-modeling process, or working with your existing database.

 **See:**
