# GraphQL Schema

Hasura's GraphQL Engine can be used to build a flexible and scalable GraphQL API on top of your existing Postgres, MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server, Athena, Snowflake, BigQuery, or Oracle database.

The Hasura GraphQL Engine automatically generates a GraphQL schema based on the tables and views in your database..

The Hasura GraphQL Engine lets you do anything you would usually do with your database by giving you GraphQL over native constructs.
