# Async Actions

## Introductionâ€‹

Sometimes you may not want to wait for an action to complete before
sending a response back to the client (say if the business logic takes a
long time). In such cases you can create an **asynchronous** action,
which returns an `action_id` immediately to the client before contacting
the handler.

If you mark an action as **asynchronous** , Hasura also generates a `query` and a `subscription` field for the action so that you can
query/subscribe to its status.

Note

Only Actions of type `mutation` can be async. Actions of type query are
always executed synchronously.

For example, let's say `place_order` is an asynchronous action

```
mutation   placeOrderRequest ( $order_input :   place_order_input ! )   {
   place_order ( input :   $order_input )
}
```

Executing this mutation will return a response like:

```
{
   "data" :   {
     "place_order" :   "23b1c256-7aff-4b95-95bd-68220d9f93f2"
   }
}
```

The returned `uuid` is the `action id` of the async action. To get the
actual response of the action, you can `query` or `subscribe` to the
action using this `action id` .

```
subscription   getPlaceOrderResponse   {
   place_order ( id :   "23b1c256-7aff-4b95-95bd-68220d9f93f2" )   {
     output
     errors
   }
}
```
