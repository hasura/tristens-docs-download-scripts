# Actions

Actions are a convenient and secure way to connect to REST APIs to achieve any business logic you may need, directly from your GraphQL API.

Maybe you need to validate, process or enrich some data, call another API, or log a user in. With Actions you can connect to a REST endpoint which can be your own custom server, a public API, or a serverless function.

You can also apply transforms to your payloads and responses and handle the response to your GraphQL client asynchronously, subscribing to results as they occur.
