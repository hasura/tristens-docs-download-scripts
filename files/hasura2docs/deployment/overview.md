# Deploy Hasura GraphQL Engine

To deploy the Hasura GraphQL Engine, we recommend using Hasura Cloud, which is a fully-managed, highly-optimized, production-ready, hosted option. With Hasura Cloud, you can deploy your GraphQL API in less than 60 seconds plus you get high availability, automatic upgrades, and observability out of the box. Alternatively, you can deploy the Hasura GraphQL Engine to a cloud provider of your choice using Docker or Kubernetes.

Regardless of where you deploy, the Hasura GraphQL Engine is highly configurable, allowing you to tailor everything to your needs.
