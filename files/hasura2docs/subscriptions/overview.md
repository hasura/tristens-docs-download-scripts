# Subscriptions

Subscriptions enable you to push data from your database to your clients in real-time, making them a powerful tool for building reactive applications without the need for continuous server polling.

Just like queries and mutations, you have subscriptions on your data out of the box with the Hasura GraphQL Engine.
