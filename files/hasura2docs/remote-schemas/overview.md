# Remote Schemas

Hasura has the ability to merge your remote GraphQL schemas and provide you with a single, unified GraphQL API. Think of it like automated schema stitching.

This enables you to write queries and mutations to disparate sources, all from your single Hasura endpoint. All you need to provide is a GraphQL service - such as a CMS, payment provider, or custom GraphQL server - and connect its HTTP endpoint to Hasura; we'll take care of the rest.
