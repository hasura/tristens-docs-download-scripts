## Activate your Enterprise Edition Trialâ€‹

### Step 1. Run Hasuraâ€‹

You can run Hasura instances in a container environment of your choice. Please follow this[ guide for getting started ](https://hasura.io/docs/latest/enterprise/getting-started/quickstart-docker/), which describes how to install Hasura GraphQL Engine using
Docker.

If you are already running Hasura inside a Docker container with open-source features, then you just need to change the
Docker container tag to `v2.23.0` or above and then redeploy the container.

Please make sure that your `docker-compose.yaml` does not have the `HASURA_GRAPHQL_EE_LICENSE_KEY` environment variable set. If you already have a license key, you can try Hasura Enterprise directly by following instructions[ here ](https://hasura.io/docs/latest/enterprise/upgrade-ce-to-ee/).

### Step 2. Register for your 30-day free Trialâ€‹

Once Hasura is running, you can register for an Enterprise Edition Trial using the Hasura Console. In the Hasura
Console, click on the `Enterprise` button in the top right and fill out the registration form.

Filling out this form will automatically create a Hasura Cloud account. **If you already have an existing Hasura Cloud
account, please use the same credentials in the form** . You can use the same Hasura Cloud account to centrally manage
all your enterprise licenses (this feature to be added soon).

Please see the[ FAQ ](https://hasura.io/docs/latest/enterprise/try-hasura-enterprise-edition/#frequently-asked-questions)section in case you are facing issues with registration.

required only once.
