# Hasura CLI

We offer two primary methods for working with your Hasura instances: the Hasura Console and the Hasura CLI. While the Console provides an easy-to-use GUI for interacting with your project, the CLI offers a powerful, text-based interface for managing your project.

The Hasura CLI is a command line tool that acts as an interface to the Hasura GraphQL Engine's Metadata API, providing a set of commands that you can use to create, migrate, and manage your Hasura projects.
