# Export OpenAPI Specification

The OpenAPI Specification (OAS) is widely used in REST API development to provide a standardized format for documenting
RESTful APIs.

You can download the OpenAPI 3 specification (OAS 3.0) as a JSON file for all the RESTified GraphQL Endpoints for admin
roles by clicking in the `Export OpenAPI Spec` button from the `REST endpoints` tab from the API section.
