# RESTified Endpoints

RESTified endpoints allow you to quickly and easily create REST endpoints without needing to write any custom code. Any query or mutation can be converted into a RESTified endpoint, complete with query parameters, arguments, and permissions.

You can also enable default CRUD REST endpoints on your data sources with just a few clicks. Once your REST endpoints are created, you can export the corresponding OpenAPI documentation to allow automatic integration with other services where available!
