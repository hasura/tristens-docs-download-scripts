# Migration File Format Reference (config v2)

## Introduction​

With `config v2` , the Migrations files generated by the CLI are pure SQL
files.

Note

For `config v1` , see[ Migration file format reference (config v1) ](https://hasura.io/docs/latest/migrations-metadata-seeds/legacy-configs/config-v1/reference/migration-file-format/)

## Migration filename format​

Each migration file has the following format:

`< version > _ < name > . { up | down } .sql`

A `version` which is the Unix timestamp in nanoseconds when the file was
created is the first part. Followed by a `name` which is either manually
added or auto-generated by the Console. The next part indicates what
step this is. If it is `up` , it means that this is the forward step,
e.g. creating a table. The `down` indicates that it is the corresponding
rollback step.

## Migration file format​

A migration SQL file can contain SQL statements which are executed on
the apply step of the migration. There can be an `up` migration and a `down` migration file.
