# Migrations, Metadata, and Seeds

Hasura Migrations, Metadata, and Seeds are a set of tools that allow you to version control your Hasura project. You can use these tools to track changes to your project and apply them to other environments. Hasura's Metadata represents the configuration state of your project. Hasura Migrations are a set of SQL files representing changes to your database over time, and Seeds are SQL files for populating your database with data.

Combined with git, you can use these tools to track changes to your project and apply them to other environments.
