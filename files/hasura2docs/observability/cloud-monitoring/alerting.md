# Alerts in Hasura Cloud

Hasura Alerts is a feature available to Cloud customers that proactively notifies you about important events and
incidents in your Hasura infrastructure. It enables you to define specific conditions and thresholds to trigger alerts,
ensuring you stay informed about critical changes and potential performance and reliability issues in real-time.

### Key benefits​

- **Faster Incident Resolution** - By receiving timely alerts, users can quickly identify incidents and take immediate
action to address them. This reduces the time it takes to detect and respond to issues, minimizing their impact on
system performance and user experience.
- **Improved Reliability** - By promptly detecting and resolving incidents, Hasura Alerts helps improve the overall
reliability. Users can proactively address potential issues before they impact end-users, resulting in enhanced system
stability and user satisfaction.
- **Performance Issue Detection** - Performance issues can arise within or downstream from Hasura infrastructure. With
alerting, users can monitor important performance metrics and receive notifications when thresholds are breached. This
allows for timely intervention and optimization, ensuring optimal system performance.
- **Root Cause Identification** - Incidents often have downstream causes that originate from outside the Hasura
infrastructure itself. Proactive alerting helps users quickly trace these issues to their root causes, enabling more
efficient troubleshooting and resolution.


## Notification channels and integrations​
