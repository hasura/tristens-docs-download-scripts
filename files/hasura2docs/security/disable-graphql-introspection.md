# Disable GraphQL Introspection

## Introduction​

The GraphQL Engine by default enables[ GraphQL Schema Introspection ](https://spec.graphql.org/June2018/#sec-Schema-Introspection)which gives full information
about the schema and may not be desired in production.

To avoid this, you can disable GraphQL introspection on a per-role basis.

## Disabling GraphQL introspection for a role​

Introspection can be disabled by navigating to the `Security` tab, selecting `Schema Introspection` and modifying or
adding the role you wish to disable introspection for.
