# Queries

With the Hasura GraphQL Engine, you get powerful, full-coverage queries right out of the box. As soon as you connect your database, you'll be able to query all your related and deeply nested data easily with the power of GraphQL. You'll also be able to aggregate, filter, sort, and paginate results.

All of this is auto-generated and is available over a single GraphQL endpoint - all you have to do is paste in your database connection string and you're good to go!
