# Use Multiple Arguments in a Query

Multiple arguments can be used together in the same query.

For example, you can use the `where` argument to filter the results and
then use the `order_by` argument to sort them.

 **For example** , fetch a list of authors and only 2 of their published
articles that are sorted by their date of publication:
