# Hasura Caching

Hasura Cloud and Enterprise Editions provide a caching layer that can be used to cache the response of a GraphQL query. This can help reduce the number of requests to your data sources and improve the performance of your application.

You have full control over the cache lifetime and can choose to force the cache to refresh when you need to. With Hasura Caching, your application is highly-optimized and performant, reducing the load on your servers. You can try caching for free with a[ 30-day trial of Hasura Enterprise Edition ](https://hasura.io/docs/latest/enterprise/try-hasura-enterprise-edition/).
